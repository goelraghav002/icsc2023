  <b>The workshop:</b> On 20 December 2013, The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2015 as the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies (IYL 2015). Celebrating IYL 2015, several activities have been organized by different academic bodies all over the world in 2015. NASI has also organized a few events to celebrate IYL 2015. It has also published two books on this occasion. Present workshop is part of yearlong celebration of IYL 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nature of the workshop will be similar to the tutorial organized prior to the international conferences. In the lectures fundamental and conceptual ideas of undergraduate optics will be discussed with a focus on state of art applications of the same. Renowned experts of respective fields will conduct the workshop. The lectures will be delivered using black board and also power point presentations. A quiz will also be organized.
